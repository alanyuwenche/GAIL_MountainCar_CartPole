GAIL to solve CartPole-v0 but fail in MountainCar-v0
I can use Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning(GAIL) to solve CartPole-v0 but fail in MountainCar-v0. The original GAIL proposed by Jonathan Ho, et al. used trust region policy optimization (TRPO) to train policy. In my code I used Proximal Policy Optimization(PPO) instead of TRPO.
